## Welcome! Thanks for visiting.

This is an open-source project. We've seeded this with content we found or generated over the last month, but Effective Immediately relies on the community to remain immediately effective for anyone affected moving forward.

We welcome contributions of all sizes, but if you submit a pull request or file issues, please keep it small and manageable.

The easiest way to submit a change right now is to contact our team at effectiveimmediately3@gmail.com. Please include:
- your name
- the resource link(s) or relevant information you wish to share
- a profile link (LinkedIn, Github, etc) that you prefer to be associated with when we credit your contribution (if you prefer to remain anonymous, please say so).
- anything else that will make your contribution more helpful (commentary, instructions, etc)

### On Attribution
Our goal is to give credit where it's due.

Original work we include will be credited fully in the main readme.

Accepted contributions of other types will be credited below unless you request to remain anonymous.

If you're familiar with Github, using issues or pull requests will automatically attribute change authors, so below we will list contributors who submit contributions by email.

Depending on how many contributions we receive, we may change how we organize the attribution credits section below.
